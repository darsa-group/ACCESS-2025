Last year we ran the first edition of ACCESS with ([ACCESS-2024](https://darsa.info/ACCESS-2024/)),
Which, due to the dedication of the students and mentors, was a [huge success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/when-ai-technology-revolutionises-biologists-vh3tf/?trackingId=yfMjRzJLxsUhWQjjFfDxJg%3D%3D).
In 2024, we received more than 100 applicantions, but could only select 20 participants, encouraging us to run the cource again.

More information and material is available on the [ACCESS-2024 website](https://darsa.info/ACCESS-2024/).
