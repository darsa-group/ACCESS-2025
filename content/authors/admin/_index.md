**AI and deep learning** are [transforming research in ecology and entomology](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2002545117), 
but starting to use and developing these methods -- and applying them to real-world problems -- can be daunting.
[InsectAI](https://insectai.eu/) ACCESS empowers early-career researchers to leverage state-of-the-art imaging techniques, AI and other methods 
to tackle challenges in insect ecology and entomology.

## Where and when
ACCESS-2025 is an **in-person, residential summer school** based in the beautiful [**Mols Bjerge National Park**](https://www.naturhistoriskmuseum.dk/mols-laboratory) 
near Aarhus, Denmark. The event will run from **September 28th** to **October 4th, 2025**. 



## What we offer
* • A fully-funded course - **free tuition, accommodation and food, and travel refunds** for the selected candidates
* • We will fully fund between 15 and 20 participants, but might be able to host a handful of self-funded candidates
* • A series of **guest lectures** and **practical workshops** from international experts
* • A **project-based** learning experience within a **multidisciplinary student team**

## Who the course is for
* • Biologists (entomologists, ecologists, etc) wanting to apply computational methods to their fields
* • Computer and data scientists (engineers, physicists, etc) seeking to translate their expertise to study insects
* • We particularly support early-career researchers (graduate students, PhDs and postdocs)

## How to take part
* • Read the [application section](#application)
* • Fill the [application form](https://forms.gle/egpk1u3Lq7Y8NXJZA)
