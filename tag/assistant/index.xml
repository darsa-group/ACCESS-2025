      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guillaume Mougeot is a postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University in the Department of Ecoscience. His work applies machine learning and computer vision techniques to address challenges in biology and ecology. He earned an engineering degree from Centrale Nantes and a Master of Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, before completing his Ph.D. in 2023 through a collaboration between Oxford Brookes University and Université Clermont Auvergne. His doctoral research focused on three-dimensional microscopy image segmentation, and he has also investigated animal species identification during his master’s studies and in his current postdoctoral work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jarrett completed his PhD in Zoology at the University of British Columbia, where he investigated applied methods of computer vision for ecology. Broadly, Jarrett is interested in using computer vision for bulk insect specimen processing. More specifically, much of his work explores the integration of data modalities such as DNA and spatiotemporal metadata within computer vision classification pipelines. Through integrating diverse data types with computer vision, Jarrett aims to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cataloging insect specimens, contributing to broader ecological and conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
